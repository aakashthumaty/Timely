Timely - Make the most out of your time

Timely listens to what you want along with how much time you have and instantly returns a list of optimal destinations.
Just enter what you’re looking for (e.g. Thai, pastries, fast, etc.) as well how much time you can afford and Timely will return a list of places that you can go to, eat at, and come back from all within the entered time frame. 

Let’s say you entered “Mexican” and “01:00,” Timely will return all the nearby Mexican eateries and establishments that you can drive to, eat at, and drive back from exactly within one hour. 

Never be late again, use Timely to make sure you're always on time!
